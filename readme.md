# Nerf Laser Boss

The Nerf Laser Boss will be a Raspberry Pi boss that will work
with the Nerf laser guns. An IR LED will send out signals to
shoot the laser guns. ~~A player will have to press the vendor
button in order to disable the boss. My vendor button is one of
those USB dongles that sends a person to a website, if you
are using a windows machine.~~

I will be using the enter key on a USB numpad. The vendor
button apparently could not handle all of the button
presses.
